              <p>
                The Metro Manila Subway is a 33.1km underground rail project
                currently being built in Metro Manila, Philippines, linking
                Valenzuela with Ninoy Aquino International Airport through 17
                stations and a depot. As the nation's first underground mass
                transit system, it is designed to handle up to 1.5 million
                passengers daily, with an initial capacity of 400,000 to 800,000
                passengers. Initiated by the Department of Transportation (DOTr)
                and approved by the National Economic Development Authority
                (NEDA), the project is part of the Duterte Administration's
                Build, Build, Build initiative. The subway's groundbreaking
                occurred in February 2019, with phase one expected to be
                finished by 2025 and the entire project slated for completion by
                July 2027.

                The Kalayaan Bridge also known as the BGC-Ortigas Link Bridge,
                was complete on June 12, 2021. Lawton Avenue and Kapitolyo are
                connected by this four-lane, two-way bridge that traverses the
                Pasig River. Its primary objective is to reduce the travel time
                between Fort Bonifacio and Ortigas to a mere 12 minutes by
                alleviating traffic congestion on main roadways such as EDSA and
                C-5. The bridge not only alleviates traffic congestion but also
                improves connectivity between critical business districts,
                thereby stimulating economic growth and development in the
                surrounding region. The enhanced accessibility has also made it
                more convenient for residents and commuters, contributing to a
                more efficient transportation network in Metro Manila.

                The Metro Rail Transit Line 7 (MRT-7) is an infrastructure
                project that will encourage better linkage between Quezon City
                and San Jose del Monte, Bulacan. This 23-kilometer elevated
                railway has a total of 14 stations placed at key points to make
                it the favorite choice for daily commuting, thereby reducing
                travel time between these two metropolitan centers by
                approximately half. This growth is expected to benefit not only
                residents but also businesses, especially in Bulacan, where it
                would create new employment opportunities and commercial
                activities. Expected to carry up to 850,000 passengers daily,
                the MRT 7 project of San Miguel Corporation is an important
                addition to improving regional public transportation networks.
                This potentially would boost the residential and commercial
                property market in the community, thereby adding upside to
                Megaworld's prospects.
